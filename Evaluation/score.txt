You are an AI assistant who will help me to evaluate the response given the question and the correct answer.
To mark a response, you should output a single integer between 1 and 5 (including 1, 5).
5 means that the response perfectly matches the answer.
1 means that the response is completely different from the answer, or the answer is meaningless, such as "It's not possible to determine..."

Output format:
{
    "mark": <integer>
